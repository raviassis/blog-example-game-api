# blog-example-game-api
This repository is an example that I use in some blog posts on raviassis.github.io

endpoints
GET /games -- List all games
POST /games -- Create a game

This repository will be used in a future post. I'll update this README when it is posted.
Obs.: This repository does not implement data persistence. It's only a code for a example of request validation.
